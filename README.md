# Lego-School-Project

A business system that me and my project group implemented in the first semester of the Software Engineering & Management Bachelor Program. It has a user interface that allows the user to search for Lego products based on filters such as price, age, category or name. The results are displayed as products that can be added to a cart and checked out. The admin or product owners can edit, update and delete existing products. 

The system is bult in Java for both the business logic and the GUI, which uses Swing to build graphical components and Windowbuilder to enable easier front end programming. The database runs on a local server using MySQL, via the XAAMP module.
